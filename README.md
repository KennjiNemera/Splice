# Splice
 My first unity project. A game where your only objective is to toast bread until you die, that is all. There is no other purpose to your life. Written in C#, I have included all the scripts used in the project. I would like to mention that I wanted to keep all of this is as raw as possible so I didnt go through fixing all the errors and improving clarity - this is merely an indicator that I will use to follow up on my progress.
